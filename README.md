Created a Facemask mask detection model with convolutional neural network using MobileNetV2 architecture in place of convolutional layer.
The model is trained from the data set obtained from kaggle which is having Mask and WithOut Mask Images.
The Model is integrated with Flask web frame work.
The trained model is then used to classify the each frame of the video captured from webcam.
